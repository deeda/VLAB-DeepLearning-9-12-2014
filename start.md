<h3>What is Deep Learning</h3>

Deep Learning is a new area of Machine Learning research, which has been introduced with the objective of moving Machine Learning closer to one of its original goals: Artificial Intelligence.

Deep Learning is about learning multiple levels of representation and abstraction that help to make sense of data such as images, sound, and text.

Deep learning is a set of algorithms in machine learning that attempt to model high-level abstractions in data by using model architectures composed of multiple non-linear transformations.

Deep learning is part of a broader family of machine learning methods based on learning representations of data. An observation (e.g., an image) can be represented in many ways (e.g., a vector of pixels), but some representations make it easier to learn tasks of interest (e.g., is this the image of a human face?) from examples, and research in this area attempts to define what makes better representations and how to create models to learn these representations.

Various deep learning architectures such as deep neural networks, convolutional deep neural networks, and deep belief networks have been applied to fields like computer vision, automatic speech recognition, natural language processing, and music/audio signal recognition where they have been shown to produce state-of-the-art results on various tasks.

Deep Learning involves iterative algorithms

It is different from the early Neural Network research in the 80s. Deep Learning involves learning using mulitple layers of abstraction and specifically, non-linear transforms.

<h3>What's New in Deep Learning?</h3>

Deep Learning provides a methodology to make sense of all the data 
Internet gives you access to a lot of data, but there needs to be a sensible methodology to organize and create classification algorithms.

Goal of Deep Learning:<br>
unlabeled data (just look at info and know its a cat for example)<br>
unsupervised pre-training -> structure NN (feature detectors) <br>
How it stacks up:<br>

Moore's Law has been going on since the dawn of man. It represents <b>humanity's capacity to compute</b><br>
Intel is not really on Moore's Law curve for last 10 years - for that you have to look to GPUs / NVidia is on Moore's curve<br>
